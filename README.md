## My useless apps
 Testing my programing skills

- scanner.py -  Terrible slow port scanner that don't know about multithreading
    
    Usage:  
    * Windows: ```python .\scanner.py <hostname or IP>```
    * Linux: ```./scanner.py  <hostname or IP>```   or ```python3 ./scanner.py  <hostname or IP>```
